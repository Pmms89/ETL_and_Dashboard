# ETL process and Dashboard

The idea was to get data from an API, extract, transform and load it to create an interactive dashboard to visualize and analyze the data at the end.

### Getting data from Free Stock API

Free Stock API called [ALPHA VANTAGE](https://www.alphavantage.co)

### Paths
1) Installing jupyter-dash and dash
2) Getting stock market data from [ALPHA VANTAGE](https://www.alphavantage.co) API
3) Defining the stocks that I want to get information
4) Defining and Calculating the information that I want to obtain
5) Creating the graphs that I wanted
6) Creating the dashboard and open it in my localhost ([html file](https://github.com/Pmms89/ETL_and_Dashboard/blob/main/Dash_stock.html) and [dashboard image view](https://github.com/Pmms89/ETL_and_Dashboard/blob/main/Dash_stock_view.pdf))
